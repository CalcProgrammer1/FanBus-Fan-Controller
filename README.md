RGB Fan Controller System for color-controlled PC mods!

This repository contains the source code, microcontroller code, EAGLE files, and related documentation for all revisions
of my RGB Fan Controller and FanBus RGB Fan Controller projects, the details of which can be found on my Instructables
pages:

The project was to modify a clear LED PC fan into a digitally controlled PC fan with 4 independently controlled RGB
LED lights which could make unique and animated color patterns, be used as a system indication LED, control the fan
speed from a user interface or automatically, and just overall be awesome!  The project was based on an Atmel
ATMega168/328 processor and supports 12 channels of software PWM to drive the LED's.  Spin-off projects were created
(by me) to do awesome stuff like flash the LED's to music but I lost interest in the project as other things started
piling up.  After requests for the code, I'm finally getting around to posting it here, where it will be organized and
easy to work on.  So, if you're here for the code, have at it!

All code that I write for this project is licensed under the General Public License (GPL) version 2.  That means if you
modify it and release binaries you must provide your changes.  I would appreciate credit for the work done here as well
if you post your creations based on my project or code, but you don't explicitly *have*  to do so if you're so inclined.
